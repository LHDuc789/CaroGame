## Research On Reinforcement Learning Methods â€“ Implement Tic-Tac-Toe (Caro)
### Description
+ Using Monte Carlo Prediction, SARSA and Q-learning methods into the training process for agents in this game. Finally, we have an agent like BOT and we can play with it. Also, the programming can save state and start training to update policy after the match if we want. This game has two modes: Player vs BOT and BOT vs BOT, we can decide who plays first in mode Player vs BOT. Having four levels: 1, 2, 3, 4 (Q-learning not complex, Monte Carlo Prediction, SARSA and Q-learning with complex reward).
+ Using Python for writing code and Tkinter for GUI.
### Setup
+ Need to install Python and Tkinter, can use Visual Studio Code.
+ Download source code and run this on Visual Studio Code.
